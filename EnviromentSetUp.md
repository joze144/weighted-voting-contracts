and create a block immediately when there is a new pending transaction.
Super convenient for testing

$ testrpc
```


### Truffle
Solidity framework. Lets you easily compile and deploy smart contracts.
You can also interact with the contracts, through the console.

```
$ sudo npm install -g truffle
```
